META-PELUX
==========
Yocto layer providing "core-image-pelux".

Maintained at https://github.com/pelagicore/meta-pelux

Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on:
* poky (http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky)
* meta-openembedded (http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/)
* meta-virtualization (http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-virtualization)
* meta-bistro (https://github.com/Pelagicore/meta-bistro)

Branching
---------
This repository will follow the yocto release system. Whenever a new yocto release has been released, a new branch with the same name will be created from the master branch. All feature growth should happen first on the master branch, but will also be cherry picked back to the latest yocto release branch. Security and bug fixes will be evaluated case by case and backported as necessary. The ambition is to actively maintain the four latest releases and/or two year old releases in this fashion.
